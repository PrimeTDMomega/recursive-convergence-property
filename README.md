## Mathematical Derivation

To derive the Recursive Convergence Property (RCP) mathematically, we need to formalize the concepts using group theory and combinatorics.

Let's define the following terms:

-   N: The number of possible moves in a single sequence (N ≤ ∞).
-   c: The total number of possible configurations for the 3x3 Rubik's cube.

Derivation:

**Step 1**: Number of configurations after `N` moves

In a single sequence of `N` moves, the cube transitions from one configuration to another. We need to calculate the number of configurations possible after `N` moves, which we denote as `C1`.

**Step 2**: Number of configurations after r repetitions

Now, we repeat the same sequence of `N` moves r times. After each repetition, the cube's configuration may change, but we are interested in finding the number of repetitions (denoted by `r`) required to bring the cube back to its initial configuration modulo c (total number of possible configurations). This can be represented as:

`r^N ≡ 1 (mod c)`

where `r` represents the number of repetitions of the sequence of `N` moves.

**Step 3**: Concluding the theorem

The equation `r^N ≡ 1 (mod c)` is crucial for the Recursive Convergence Property. It states that after r repetitions of the sequence of N moves, the cube will return to its initial configuration modulo the total number of possible configurations (`c`). This property arises due to the finite number of possible configurations the cube can take on, as well as the reversibility of its moves. Since r represents the minimum number of repetitions required for the cube to return to its starting state, it satisfies the Recursive Convergence Property.

Mathematically, we can represent the number of possible configurations (P) for a 3x3 Rubik's cube as follows:

` P = C1 = C2 = C3 = ... = C(r-1) = Cr `

Thus, the theorem is proved, and the equation `r^N ≡ 1 (mod c)` demonstrates that if an algorithm with `N` moves is repeated `r`times, the cube will come back to the initial position modulo the total number of possible configurations (`c`). The value of r represents the minimum number of repetitions required for the cube to return to its starting state.
