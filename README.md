## The Recursive Convergence Property (RCP)

The Recursive Convergence Property refers to a fundamental characteristic of puzzles like the 3x3 Rubik's cube, where repeating a specific sequence of moves eventually leads to the convergence of the cube's configurations back to its initial state. In other words, after performing the same sequence of moves a certain number of times, the cube returns to the exact arrangement of colors it started with.

This property arises due to the finite number of possible configurations that the cube can take on. With each move, the cube transitions from one valid configuration to another. Since there are only a limited number of configurations possible, and each move is reversible (you can undo any move by performing the inverse move), repeating the same sequence of moves will eventually cause the cube to revisit configurations it has been in before.

As the repetition process continues, the configurations encountered by the cube form a cyclic pattern. Eventually, the cube cycles back to its initial configuration, and this cycle continues indefinitely with each subsequent repetition.

Hence, I present to you the **Law of Recursive Convergence Property of Cubes** ![Recursive Convergence Property](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeTDMomega/repetition-convergence-property/main/resources/imgs/law-of-rcp.png)

## Group Theory

Group theory ties into the Recursive Convergence Property (RCP) of the Rubik's cube in several key ways, explaining and formalizing the cyclical behavior observed when repeating a sequence of moves. Here's how group theory concepts are directly relevant to understanding RCP:

1.  **Group Structure of Cube Moves**: Group theory provides a formal framework to describe the Rubik's cube moves as a mathematical group. The set of all possible cube configurations forms the elements of this group, and the cube moves (turns of faces) represent the binary operation. The group axioms ensure that the cube moves satisfy closure (the result of a move is another valid configuration), associativity (the order of moves doesn't matter), identity (the starting configuration is the identity element), and inverses (each move has an inverse move that undoes its effect).
    
2.  **Cyclic Subgroups**: Within the Rubik's cube group, each sequence of moves generates a cyclic subgroup. A cyclic subgroup is a subset of the group that is generated by a single element (the sequence of moves). Repeating the sequence cyclically generates a subgroup that consists of configurations reachable by that specific sequence.
    
3.  **Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem**: Group theory concepts like cosets and Lagrange's theorem play a role in counting the number of unique configurations that can be reached from the initial state by repeating a specific sequence of moves. The number of unique configurations is related to the order of the subgroup generated by that sequence.
    
4.  **Order of Elements and RCP**: In group theory, the order of an element refers to the number of times the binary operation needs to be applied to obtain the identity element. For the Rubik's cube, the order of a sequence of moves corresponds to the number of repetitions needed to return to the initial configuration. Group theory's understanding of orders of elements helps explain why the cube's configurations cycle back to the starting state after a certain number of repetitions.
    
5.  **Cayley Graphs and Visualization**: Cayley graphs, a concept from group theory, can be used to visually represent the Rubik's cube move sequences and their connections. These graphs help illustrate the cyclical nature of the cube's configurations and aid in understanding the RCP.
    

## Mathematical Derivation

To derive the Recursive Convergence Property mathematically, we need to formalize the concepts using group theory and combinatorics.

Let's define the following terms:

-   N: The number of possible moves in a single sequence (n ≤ ∞).
-   P: The number of possible configurations for the 3x3 Rubik's cube after N moves in a single sequence.

Derivation:

**Step 1**: Number of configurations after N moves In a single sequence of N moves, the cube transitions from one configuration to another. We need to calculate the number of configurations possible after N moves, which we denote as C1.

**Step 2**: Number of configurations after R repetitions Now, we repeat the same sequence of N moves R times. After the first repetition, the cube revisits a configuration it has been in before (assuming R is finite). So, after the second repetition, it will also revisit a configuration it has been in before, and this process will continue.

Let's say that after the kth repetition (where 1 ≤ k ≤ R), the cube revisits a configuration it has been in before. Let's call the number of configurations that can be reached from the initial position after k repetitions as Ck.

**Step 3**: Number of configurations after R repetitions We know that after R repetitions, the cube will revisit the initial configuration. So, after R repetitions, the number of configurations, Cr, would be the same as the number of configurations after the first repetition (C1), i.e., Cr = C1.

**Step 4**: Number of configurations after R-1 repetitions Now, we'll prove that the number of configurations after R-1 repetitions (i.e., C(R-1)) is the same as the number of configurations after the first repetition (C1).

After the (R-1)th repetition, the cube would have revisited a configuration it has been in before (C(R-1) = Ck, where k < R). Now, one more repetition (Rth repetition) will bring it back to the initial configuration (C(R) = C1).

Since the cube cannot reach any new configuration after the Rth repetition (as it repeats), C(R) = C1. But we already established that Cr = C1, so C(R-1) = C1.

**Step 5**: Concluding the theorem we have shown that after R-1 repetitions, the cube reaches the same number of configurations as after the first repetition (C(R-1) = C1). This implies that the cube revisits the initial configuration after R repetitions.

Mathematically, we can represent the number of possible configurations (P) for a 3x3 Rubik's cube as follows: P = C1 = C2 = C3 = ... = C(R-1) = Cr

Thus, the theorem is proved that if an algorithm with N moves is repeated R times, the cube will come back to the initial position.

## RCP & God's Number : Are They Related ?

The Recursive Convergence Property (RCP) and God's Number are two interconnected concepts that provide valuable insights into the nature of the Rubik's cube and its solvability. While they may seem distinct at first glance, a deeper examination reveals a strong relationship between them.

**1. Understanding RCP:** RCP refers to the fascinating property of the Rubik's cube where repeating a specific sequence of moves eventually leads to the convergence of configurations back to the initial state. In other words, after performing the same sequence of moves a certain number of times, the cube returns to the exact arrangement of colors it started with. RCP arises due to the finite number of possible configurations the cube can take on, as well as the reversibility of its moves. This property is fundamental to the cyclical behavior observed when solving the cube.

**2. Unraveling God's Number:** God's Number represents the maximum number of moves required to solve any configuration of the Rubik's cube from any starting state. It represents the worst-case scenario for solving the cube optimally and provides an upper bound on its complexity. The calculation of God's Number involves an exhaustive search through all possible configurations to find the longest optimal solution.

**The Intriguing Connection:** The relationship between RCP and God's Number lies in the cyclical nature of the Rubik's cube configurations. RCP ensures that the number of possible configurations is finite and forms cycles. As a result, after a certain number of repetitions of a specific sequence of moves, the cube revisits configurations it has been in before. This fact is critical for understanding the upper bound on the complexity of the cube.

God's Number, as the worst-case solution length, is affected by the cyclical nature of configurations. Because the cube returns to previously visited states after a certain number of repetitions, the exhaustive search for God's Number becomes more manageable. The cyclic patterns effectively reduce the number of unique configurations that need to be considered during the search, making it a more feasible task.

**Practical Implications:** The relationship between RCP and God's Number has practical implications for solving the Rubik's cube. While God's Number sets the theoretical limit for solving any cube configuration, RCP provides solvers with the confidence that a solution path will eventually cycle back to a known state. This knowledge encourages the development of efficient solving algorithms that recognize repetitive patterns and take advantage of the cube's cyclic nature.
